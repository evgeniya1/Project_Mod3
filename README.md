# Grade distribution analysis of UW Madison dataset

This project is devoted to the analysis of A-grade fraction distribution. It is mainly focused on hypothesis test aimed to identify difference between groups formed according to class size, field of study, and instructors.

## Data collection

Dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/Madgrades/uw-madison-courses. This dataset contains information about the University of Wisconsin - Madison classes taught between 2006 and 2017 that includes 22 terms. Initial set contains 193,262 classes taught by 18,598 instructors in 200 subjects. After filtering S/U, Cr/N and missing (zero-size class) grades, missing sections and instructors, the dataset includes information about 74,853 classes.

## Problem formulation

These are the questions to answer:

- What is the influence of an instructor on A-grades fraction?
- What is the influence of class size on A-grades fraction?
- Where bimodality comes from? Is it a class size?
- What is the A-grades fraction distribution for a specific instructor with respect to the class size?
- What is the influence of STEM versus humanity field of study with respect to the class size?
